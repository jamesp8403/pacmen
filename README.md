# pacmen

## Description

This project allows you to create multiple Pac-Men and move them across the screen at the click of a button. 

## How to Run

To run the program, you can clone the repo in GitHub and load the HTML, JS and CSS files. From there, you can 
click on the "Add PacMan" button to add as many PacMen as you want, and then click the "Start Game" button to
see them move across the screen. You can always add more PacMen later if you want.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements

In the future, I would also like to add ghosts of different colors that can also populate the screen.
